# Warframe Vote

The data is scrubbed from [Falterfire](http://warframe.wikia.com/wiki/User:Falterfire)'s [Module:Weapons/data](http://warframe.wikia.com/wiki/Module:Weapons) lua script. Currently data is fetched everytime page is loaded (hopefully wiki dont mind it..).

The goal is to create a website to vote a weapon is worth to build or just an MR-fodder. The vote will be divided into two types: anonymous or identified. Identified vote is counted from user whose vote after login either via Facebook, Google, Twitter, etc.

## Usage

- cd to dir, then run `npm install`
- Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/
